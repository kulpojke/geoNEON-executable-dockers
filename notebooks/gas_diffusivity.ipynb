In our bayesian model we will be drawing particle size fractions from a distribution and using those values to calculate the relationship between $\\Psi$ based on  $\\epsilon$  using the method described above.  There will thus be a distribution of values for $\\Psi$, and a a resulting deterministic (unless I add noise later) distribution of values for $\\epsilon$. The log-log regressing to find b can be performed to find a posterior for b. \n",

    "The soil pits are often very lose to the base of the tower, rather than scattered about the tower footprint.  Furthermore, since soil composition veries so much over space it hardly seems reasonable to try to estimate the actual values for sand and clay at each sensor location.  Instead we will just define a joint probablitity distribution of sand, caly and silt percentages based on the observed data.  We can draw from it later as a model parameter."
