Furthermore, since soil composition veries so much over space it hardly seems reasonable to try to estimate the actual values for sand and clay at each sensor location.  Instead we will just define a joint probablitity distribution of sand, clay and silt percentages based on the observed data.  We can draw from it later as a model parameter.\n",
