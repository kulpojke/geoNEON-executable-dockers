# geoNEON executable dockers #

Dockers with executable scripts to be called from the command line.  I try to make the scripts as flexible as possible but you should examine the dockerfiles and start scripts before using to ensure they make sense for yor system and application.

## Setup ##

You need to have docker installed (or Singularity).

## Executale dockers ##

Here is the list of executable dockers.  This is a work in progress, more will be added in the future.
